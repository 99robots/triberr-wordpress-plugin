== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will I be able to select certain categories to send to Triberr?

Right now, all posts go to Triberr, but you can delete them from you Sent Stream. Future versions will give you control over which posts you send.

= If I make a change to a post, will Triberr import it again?

Triberr will check to see if we already know about the post in our database. If so, we will not import it again.

= Can I also import older posts into Triberr using this plugin?

No, Triberr will only accept posts published within the last 2 weeks.
