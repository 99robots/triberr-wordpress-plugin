== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will I be able to select certain categories to send to Triberr?

Right now, all posts go to Triberr, but you can delete them from you Sent Stream. Future versions will give you control over which posts you send.

= If I make a change to a post, will Triberr import it again?

Triberr will check to see if we already know about the post in our database. If so, we will not import it again. 

= Can I also import older posts into Triberr using this plugin?

No, Triberr will only accept posts published within the last week.

= If my post gets syndicated to other blogs, will I get the credit.

Yes. Every reBlog results in the Author info pulled along with the content, so regardless of where your post is published you will be prominently featured as the Author.
